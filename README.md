About the Projects in this Repository:
  WIP: ToDoAndCounter is a Tasks Manager that also have a cowntdown timer.
    The current version has a countdown timer where the user can set how many minutes and start, pause or reset the timer. Notifications/Alarms to be implemented in the future. It also has a SQLite To do list where the user can add, edit or delete a task. 
    
  WIP: SimpleGames will have 2 or 3 simples games, but right now it only has Tic Tac Toe
    In this first version, the main activity only have a text and a working menu. The tic tac toe activity is a follow along from Coding in Flow (youtube channel) with comment explanations I did to in part to remember what he said, to exercise commenting the code and dissecting other people's code, but also to help anyone with less Android/programing knowledge than I.
