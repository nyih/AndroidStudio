*WIP = Work In Progress.*

 **About the Projects in this Repository:**
 
  *WIP:* ***ToDoAndCounter*** is a Tasks Manager that also have a cowntdown timer.
  
The current version has a countdown timer where the user can set how many minutes and start, pause or reset the timer. Notifications/Alarms to be implemented in the future. It also has a SQLite To do list where the user can add, edit or delete a task. 
    
  *WIP:* ***SimpleGames*** will have 2 or 3 simples games, right now it has a simple Tic Tac Toe (with no AI) and a Hangman game.
  
In this 1st version, the main activity only have a text and a working menu. The tic tac toe activity is a follow along from Coding in Flow (youtube channel) with comment explanations I did to in part to remember what he said, to exercise commenting the code and dissecting other people's code, but also to help anyone with less Android/programing knowledge than I.

In this 2nd version, main acctivity haven't changed, but now there is a Hangman game to play. Single player has random 4 letters words for the user to try to guess. "Multiplayer", the user writes the word to be guessed and another person will try to figure it out in the same device. This new game also have the code commented with explanations.
