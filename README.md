This Repository is my main folder for College related projects and my practice projects as well.

*WIP = Work In Progress.*

 ## About the Projects in this Repository:
 
###  *WIP:* ***ToDoAndCounter*** is a Tasks Manager that also have a cowntdown timer.
  
The current version has a countdown timer where the user can set how many minutes and start, pause or reset the timer. Notifications/Alarms to be implemented in the future. It also has a SQLite To do list where the user can add, edit or delete a task. 
    
###  *WIP:* ***SimpleGames*** will have 4 or 5 simples games, right now it has a simple Tic Tac Toe, a Hangman game and a Memory game.

The idea with this project is to train my logic skills while practicing android development. In this project I experiment with new views, dynamically creating views and layouts and anything else that picks my curiosity. I also try to make my code the most efficient I can by minimizing repetition.  

In this **1st version**, the main activity only have a text and a working menu. The tic tac toe activity is a follow along from Coding in Flow (youtube channel) with comment explanations I did to in part to remember what he said, to exercise commenting the code and dissecting other people's code, but also to help anyone with less Android/programing knowledge than I.

In this **2nd version**, main acctivity haven't changed, but now there is a Hangman game to play. Single player has random 4 letters words for the user to try to guess. "Multiplayer", the user writes the word to be guessed and another person will try to figure it out in the same device. This new game also have the code commented with explanations. 

In this **3nd version**, ladscape views have been created, data persistence added, simple AI for TicTacToe is now fully working with no bugs and there is only one bug left to solve in the hangman game, but it doesn't afect the game performance. Memory game is on the way and minimax AI for tictactoe is a work in progress.

In this **4th version**, Memory game have been added to the games list and it's fully working but onSaveInstanceState and onRestoreInstanceState are still to be implemented and so is the Minimax for the tic tac toe. A test with launcher logo change have also been made. It's not pretty but it's different. Eventualy I plan to meke editable settings for the memory game.
